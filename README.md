# generalizedpoisson
This repository contains an efficient Generalized Poisson Solver originally developed to study nano electronic devices where combinations of several oxides are used in conjunction. However, it can also be applied to a wide range of problems and can handle both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
